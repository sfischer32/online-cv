career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      In my many years of professional experience in a medium-sized mechanical engineering company, 
      I was able to hold a variety of different positions. Starting with a dual degree in mechanical engineering, 
      after completing my studies I worked as a calculation engineer and expanded the topic of strength calculations and simulations. 
      This was followed by further positions as innovation manager, technical product manager and senior project manager. 
      In the role of Technical Product Manager and Senior Project Manager, I led extensive development programs. 
      This also included large development projects in the area of software development. 
      In particular, it was about the development of an IoT environment and the development of a digital platform. 
      In this context, I have extensive experience in managing large specialist projects, both as an overall project manager, 
      as a product owner and at times as a Scrum Master. My strengths lie in the areas of digital business, strategic planning 
      as well as in the areas of IoT and data analytics.
